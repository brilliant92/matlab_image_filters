# Edge Detecton and Image Stretching
Submitted for Model-Based Computer Vision at Simon Fraser University. Implements the Canny Edge Detection algorithm and an Image stretching algorithm in order to better define contrast in images.

Both files are written in Matlab.


## canny.m
My implementation of the canny edge detector. To test on image, replace "photo.jpg" with the image name.

## stretch.m
Stretches the grayscale values of an image (0 - 255) in order to increase the contrast of the image. Values a and b can be chosen depending on where lies the most concentration of pixel values.
